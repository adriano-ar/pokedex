# Pokedex app

Hey guys!

This is a small Pokedex app I'm currently working on. As you can see, there's a list of the original 150 (\*151) pokemons. If you click in any of them, you'll get a detailed page of the pokemon. There's also a search bar. I'll probably continue to make this better, so adding sorting tools to the title bar will be one feature to add soon.

## Now, for the technical part:

-   I started the app from scratch, installing and configuring the packages and dependencies I saw fit (linting and formatting tools, testing tools, typescript mandatory stuff, etc). I would have used Parser instead of Webpack (because it's a small app), but it sometimes gets trickier with some config.
-   I did my own styling from scratch, using plain css (\*scss). There's a bit of work left there, as I still can make things better by using SASS variables for colors and font changes. Will leave that for later. Also, the app is not fully responsive, so that's something I will also add soon.
-   I added Typescript and did some testing as well.

I hope you guys like it!
